The F1 score provides a single measure of a model's accuracy by considering both precision (the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions) and recall (the proportion of true positives out of all actual positive instances).\n","\n","For instance, if a model predicts that there are 100 instances of a certain class, but only 70 of those are correct, the precision would be 0.70 (or 70%). If there are actually 120 instances of that class, the recall would be approximately 0.58 (or 58%). The F1 score would be calculated as the harmonic mean of these two values, resulting in a score of about 0.63. This imperfect F1 score indicates that the model is not classifying all instances perfectly.\n","\n","Moreover, examining the F1 scores for each individual class helps us identify specific classes that the model finds challenging to classify accurately. For example, if the F1 score for the 'Iris-setosa' class is 0.90, but for 'Iris-virginica' it is only 0.60, this suggests that the model is much better at identifying 'Iris-setosa' compared to 'Iris-virginica'.
