It works by creating new binary columns for each unique category in the original variable, where each column represents one possible category. This way, the categorical data is converted into a format that algorithms can easily process without assuming any inherent order or priority between the categories. For instance, in the 'Sex' column, which contains categories such as 'male' and 'female', one-hot encoding would generate two new columns, one for each category, with a binary value of 1 or 0 to indicate the presence of that category for each record."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zxl62Q0-9ay1","outputId":"1b2e62ad-3707-424d-fc21-26d413fc9221"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array(['male', 'female'], dtype=object)"]},"execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Return unique values from the Sex column\n","titanic_df[\"Sex\"].unique()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sXIAVO4Z9ay8"},"source":["Machine learning classifiers are unable to handle string values directly, so categorical data must be converted into a numerical form. There are two primary methods for doing this:\n","\n","1. **Label Encoding**: This technique assigns a unique integer to each category, such as 0 for 'male' and 1 for 'female'. However, this approach introduces a problem—by using numbers, it suggests a ranking or order between the categories, which can confuse some machine learning models into thinking one category is inherently 'greater' than the other.\n","\n","2. **One-Hot Encoding**: This method avoids the issue of implied order by creating separate binary columns for each category. For example, instead of assigning numbers to 'male' and 'female', one-hot encoding creates two new columns—`Sex_male` and `Sex_female`. If a person is `male`, there will be a 1 in the `Sex_male` column and a 0 in the `Sex_female` column, and vice versa for females. This method ensures each category is treated independently, without any implied hierarchy.\n","\n","In pandas, a straightforward way to perform one-hot encoding is by using the `get_dummies()` function, which automatically generates these binary columns for categorical variables in your dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hMLpI7IP9azC","outputId":"8973bd4a-7ecd-4abf-edda-ef096ce958d7"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>SibSp</th>\n","      <th>Parch</th>\n","      <th>Ticket</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","      <th>Sex_female</th>\n","      <th>Sex_male</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Braund, Mr. Owen Harris</td>\n","      <td>22.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>A/5 21171</td>\n","      <td>7.2500</td>\n","      <td>S</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...</td>\n","      <td>38.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>PC 17599</td>\n","      <td>71.2833</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Heikkinen, Miss.
