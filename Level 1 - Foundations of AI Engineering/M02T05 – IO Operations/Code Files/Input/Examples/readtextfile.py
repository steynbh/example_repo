# =========== Encoding Files =========== #

# When you run the unencoded example you may notice that the output
# displays strange characters.
# This can be fixed by specifying the encoding scheme,
# UTF-8 or UTF-8-SIG, as an additional argument to the open() function.
# utf-8-sig is a variation of the utf-8 encoding that
# includes a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file.
# The BOM is a special marker that indicates the file is UTF-8 encoded.
# By using utf-8-sig, you can avoid the appearance
# of strange characters at the beginning of the text,
# as the BOM is properly handled.
# When you run the encoded example, using utf-8-sig,
# you will notice that the data is transformed so that
# it is compatible for reading.
